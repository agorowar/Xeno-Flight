This game was designed as a Final Project for CPI 111: Game Development I (2018 Spring)

Overview: A short backstory of the game is that aliens are invading the world, and there is one ship that can defeat the aliens. The player wins if they can defeat a boss at the end of the level. The player must shoot down or dodge fire from alien ships on the way towards the boss. Along the level can collect health canisters and weapon upgrades. Score is gained over time while alive and from shooting down other ships. The game is over when the player takes too much damage from either the boss or the other alien ships.  The genre of the game is a bullet hell or shoot ‘em up.
